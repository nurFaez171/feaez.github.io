<p style="font-size: medium; color:rgb(0, 0, 0);"><b style="font-size: xx-large;">The island of Pulau Aur is in the state of Johor and is situated off the southeast coast of Peninsular Malaysia. It is a well-liked location for diving and snorkeling aficionados due to its immaculate coral reefs, crystal-clear seas, and abundant marine life. It is a part of the 5 Johor Marine Park.</b></p>

<li>
	In January 1804, Pulau Aur served as a stopover for French forces under the command of Admiral Linois, along with five warships, to carry out a naval battle mission against the British in the South China Sea.
</li> 
<li> 
	In terms of history, Aur has been known by Chinese sailors for centuries. Maps printed in the 17th century, drawing information from the famous voyages of Admiral Zheng He in the 15th century, identify Aur as two islands (indeed, it appears as such from a distance) based on its two peaks, Xi Zhu Shan (West Bamboo Mountain) and Dong Zhu Shan (East Bamboo Mountain).
</li>
<li> 	
	In the 19th century, Aur housed a rapidly growing population of around 1,400 inhabitants, including fishermen, traders, and servants. The islands served as an ideal location for pirates to conduct their activities, such as raiding, plundering, trading in slaves, and sinking a significant number of boats during fierce raids with foreign vessels on their way to Indonesia or Thailand and beyond.
</li>
<li>
	Known as Batu Berhala, the big lion-shaped rock on Pulau Aur is considered a sacred stone and was supposedly previously home to beneficent spirits called 'orang bunian'. These ghosts are said to have hidden a treasure trove from a Chinese shipwreck in a hidden cave on Batu Berhala.

	People who asked for help from these kind spirits and believed in them would carry out certain rites to please the spirits. The door on the rock's face would open once the offerings were accepted. The cave, with all the amenities one could want, was accessible by a tube.
